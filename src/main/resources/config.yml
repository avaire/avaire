# Welcome to the AvaIre Configuration
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Below you'll find all the configurable options for Ava, if you're using
# a plugin that you want to configure, you should look for a config file
# in the "plugins/plugin name" folder.
#
# The configuration is written in a format known as YAML, you can learn
# more about the format at https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml
#
# Need to validate if the config has no errors and will pass Avas config
# management system? Try out https://codebeautify.org/yaml-validator
#
# Got any questions? Contact the development team on the official support
# server for Ava at https://avairebot.com/support
#

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Application Environment
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The application environment determines what is logged to the console, and
# what applications are loaded, this is to give a better user experience
# since having the console flooded with information can be very
# overwhelming if you don't know what you're looking at.
#
# AvaIre supports two different environments, "production" and "development"
#
# Production is used for minimal console output and for all parts of the
# application to be enabled. Development is used for debugging messages
# and preventing some parts of the application from running, to stop
# in-development changes from ruining the production environment.
#

environment: 'production'

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Discord Application Information
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Discord application information is things like your application token,
# application id, application secret, etc. To run a Discord bot you'll
# need an application token, if you don't already have an application
# with discord you can easily create one in two minutes.
#
# Start by going to the link below, create a new application, give it some
# name, then click on "Create a Bot User", and you're good to go!
# https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me
#
# AvaIre needs your Discord application token to login and interact with
# users, and optionally the application ID for handling music using
# Lavalink instead of doing it internally, you can also use the
# application ID to create a invite link for your bot.
#

discord:

  # This is your Discord application client id, if you don't have a Discord
  # application, check the link above and follow the short guide to
  # create one, once you have it, replace the text between the
  # quotes with your client id.
  #
  clientId: 'YourBotClientIdShouldGoHere'

  # This is your Discord application token, if you don't have a Discord
  # application, check the link above and follow the short guide to
  # create one, once you have it, replace the text between the
  # quotes with your token.
  #
  token: 'YourBotTokenShouldGoHere'

  # This is the OAuth2 URL used for invite links, you should replace
  # the "<client_id>" with your Discord application client ID to
  # make the link valid so people can actually use it to invite
  # your bot to their server.
  #
  oauth: 'https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=<client_id>&scope=bot&permissions=66186303'

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Database Information
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# AvaIre uses a database for storing things like custom prefixes, playlists,
# user XP and levels, statistics, autoroles, aliases and everything else.
#
# AvaIre currently supports MySQL and SQLite database types, with support for
# more types coming in the future, to get started simply just populate the
# fields below with your database login information.
#
# Note: When using a MySQL database make sure the database user has permission
# to create, delete and edit tables in the database you want to use, Ava uses
# a migration system that will create all the needed tables, and roll out
# changes between versions automatically, this require creating new
# tables, and editing and deleting existing tables.
#

database:

  # This is the database type that Ava should use, "MySQL" is used by default however
  # it can be changed to "SQLite" if you'd like to use a flatfile database instead.
  #
  type: 'mysql'

  #------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # SQLite Settings
  #------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #
  # Ths is the SQLite settings used in Ava, by default MySQL is used so if
  # you want to use the SQLite setup, change the "type" value above to
  # SQLite and you should be good to go!
  #
  # SQLite does not require any external software to be installed to use it.
  #

  # This is the name of the flatfile used for the SQLite database, although
  # SQLite has support for in-memory databases, Ava does not yet support
  # them, if you just want to try using SQLite you should be fine
  # leaving the value as "database.sqlite"
  #
  filename: 'database.sqlite'

  #------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # MySQL Settings (Recommended)
  #------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #
  # This is the MySQL settings used in Ava, MySQL is used by default and is
  # recommend for use in general as it's more stable and has more features
  # than SQLite. You must install a MySQL server to use the MySQL database
  # settings, if you're on hosting the bot on a VPS, using the default
  # "mysql-server" package should be fine, if you're on Windows/Mac,
  # using something like XAMPP is a great alternative.
  #
  # XAMPP Website: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
  #

  # This is the name of the database that Ava should use for all tables.
  #
  database: 'avaire'

  # This is the hostname of the database, if you're hosting the database on
  # the same machine the bot is also hosted on you should be fine keeping
  # it as "localhost", if you're using an external server for database
  # hosting you could use the IP address here.
  #
  hostname: 'localhost'

  # This is the username for the user that should be used by Ava to access
  # the database, the user should have permission to create, read,
  # update and delete tables in order for Ava to work correctly.
  #
  username: 'username'

  # The password for the database user, used to access the database.
  #
  password: 'password'

  # Determine if server certificates should be verified upon connecting to
  # the database, disabling this will still allow for a valid connection
  # from a cryptographic perspective, but the database server will not
  # be verified if it is actually the right server or not.
  #
  verifyServerCertificate: true

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Default Command Prefix
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# All internal commands registered with Ava will be linked to a command
# category, each category has a default prefix which are used for all
# commands linked to that category, below you can set the default
# prefix used by all the official AvaIre command categories.
#
# Note: Plugins that adds commands and categories to the Ava registry doesn't
# necessarily have to follow the default prefix set below, check in with the
# developer for the plugin about the command prefix if one is used, or just
# change the prefix for the category using the "Change Prefix" command.
#

default-prefix: '!'

# The system commands can only be used by bot administrators, bot
# administrators are users who have their user ID in the
# "botAccess" field in the config.
#
system-prefix: ';'

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bot Status
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Once every minute, Ava will change her "playing" status to something on
# the list below, you can define what type of status it is by prefixing
# the status with one of the options below.
#
#   "watching:something" This produces "Watching something"
#   "listening:some cool music" This produces "Listening to some cool music"
#   "streaming:video games" This produces "Streaming video games"
#
# If no prefix is given the playing status type will be used instead.
#

playing:
  - '!help'
  - 'watching:avairebot.com'
  - 'listening:%users% users'
  - 'playing:in %guilds% servers'

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Music Lavalink Nodes (Advanced Music Settings)
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Lavalink is used internally in Ava to delegate sending and encoding jobs,
# using Lavalink makes it easy to provided good quality music to everyone
# around the world at the same time by spreading the needed resources
# for streaming music out to external encoding nodes.
#
# Lavalink is NOT a requirement to use the music features in Ava, it's
# simply an alternative way to deliver the end result to the user,
# for more information about Lavalink checkout:
#
# https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink
#

lavalink:

  # This determines if Ava should use Lavalink for encoding and sending the
  # audio instead of doing it internally, if Lavalink is enabled and no
  # valid nodes has been provided, none of the music will work.
  #
  enabled: false

  # This is your Lavalink encoding nodes, each node must have a valid name
  # that the node is identified by, a valid web-socket host and port,
  # and a valid password for the given Lavalink node.
  #
  # If a encoding node is closed, all music that is streamed through the node
  # will stop and the load-balancer built into Lavalink will begin to
  # spread the load out to the remaining working nodes.
  #
  nodes:
    - name : "local"
      host : "ws://localhost:5555"
      pass : "youshallnotpass"
    - name : "remote1"
      host : "ws://192.168.1.20:5556"
      pass : "youshallnotpass"
    - name : "remote2"
      host : "ws://lavalink.example.com:5557"
      pass : "youshallnotpass"

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Music Activity Settings
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Music Activity is a tracking system built into Ava that disconnects the
# bot from voice channels if no one is listening to music anyway, this
# can help free up memory and bandwidth that wasn't being used to
# serve users anyway.
#
# The music activity tracks a few things:
#
#   1. When no one is listening to the music, like when the bot is muted,
#   everyone is deafened, or no one is in the voice channel with the bot.
#
#   2. If the queue is empty, when you request a song by name the queue
#   will be empty until the user selects the song they want to be
#   played, this applies here, if the last song in the queue is
#   playing it will disconnect once the song is done anyway.
#
#   3. If the music is paused, this should be self-explanatory, if you
#   pause the music the bot it will disconnect after awhile unless
#   it is unpaused(resumed).
#

music-activity:

  # This determines if the music activity tracker should be enabled or not,
  # if set to false all the values below will never be used and the bot
  # will stay connect to voice channels regardless of time, until the
  # queue is either empty of it is forced to leave by a user.
  #
  enabled: true

  # This is the time in minutes that the bot should wait before disconnecting
  # if no one is listening to the bot.
  #
  # Note: Other bots does not count as valid listeners.
  #
  missing-listeners: 5

  # This is the time in minutes that the bot should wait before disconnecting
  # if the queue is empty and nothing is added before the timer runs out.
  #
  empty-queue-timeout: 2

  # This is the time in minutes that the bot should wait before disconnecting
  # if the music is paused.
  #
  paused-music-timeout: 10

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Audio Encoding and Resampling Quality
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Audio encoding and audio resampling is a way to control the quality of
# audio the bot will deliver for music related commands.
#
# Lower encoding and resampling will use less memory and CPU, but will also
# produce worse audio quality in the end, while higher encoding and
# resampling will use more memory and CPU but will in turn produce
# more clear and "crisp" audio.
#

audio-quality:

    # Audio resampling is tasked with sending the data from the server the bot
    # is hosted on to the Discord servers so people can listen to the music.
    #
    # Higher resampling rates gives a higher chance that the audio reaches
    # Discord servers so people can hear the audio by sending each frame
    # multiple times, higher resampling uses more CPU since it has to
    # send each frame multiple times.
    #
    # The supported resampling qualities are:
    #     "high", "medium", and "low"
    #
    resampling: 'medium'

    # Audio encoding is tasked with encoding the audio track so it is playable by
    # Discord, higher values will produce a higher quality encoded track, which
    # in turn uses more CPU, while lower values will produce a worse quality
    # audio track but ues less CPU to do so.
    #
    # The encoding value must be a number between 0 and 10.
    #
    encoding: 10

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bot Access (Bot Administrators)
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The list below should contain a list of user IDs of people you want to be
# able to access all system commands for Ava, things like restarting,
# system information, code evaluation, etc.
#
# You can find your user ID by using the !userid command in Ava.
#

botAccess:
  - '88739639380172800'

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Sentry.io Error Logging
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Sentry.io is an open source error tracking service, it can provide a lot
# of helpful information to developers on what is going wrong, and where
# in real-time, Sentry.io uses a DSN url for establishing a link
# between the bot and their service, you can enter your DSN
# url below if yo want to enable Sentry.io error logging.
#
# To learn more, checkout: https://sentry.io/welcome/
#

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Web Servlet - Prometheus Metrics & API
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Ava uses an internal API to power outside applications by allowing the
# apps to pull information about the bot directly from it, it also
# collects and exposes internal metrics which can be helpful for
# seeing what is happening inside the bot in real-time, all
# this is powered by an internal web servlet.
#
# The API are exposed on "ip:port", where the port is the web servlet port
# defined below, note that only the routes that are enabled will actually
# be exposed through the API, so you can fine tune what you want to
# expose to the rest of the world.
#

web-servlet:

  # Ava uses Prometheus metrics for tracking a long list of different things
  # within the application during runtime, the metrics are then displayed
  # using Grafana to users on a web-dashboard using graphs.
  #
  # For setup guides, see:
  #
  #   https://prometheus.io/
  #   https://grafana.com/
  #
  metrics: true

  # Ava exposes some API endpoints for interacting with the bot or pulling
  # information about of the bot in real-time, below you'll find a list
  # of different types of API endpoints which can be exposed in
  # the internal API.
  #
  api-routes:

    # Exposes a per-server leaderboard route for getting the 100 users on
    # the given server ID, as well as some level role and XP settings
    # information.
    #
    # Route:
    #   GET  /leaderboard/:id
    #
    leaderboard: true

    # Exposes a player cleanup route which for getting a list of expired user
    # XP records, any IDs returned from the route are IDs for users who are
    # no long on the server the record is attached to.
    #
    # Route:
    #   GET  /players/cleanup
    #
    players: true

    # Exposes multiple guild information routes, as well as cleanup routes,
    # the information routes can be used to pull information about a
    # specific server by their ID, or to check if the bot is on the
    # server with the given ID, while the cleanup routes can be
    # used to get or delete expired and old records for guilds
    # the bot is no longer on.
    #
    # Routes:
    #   POST /guilds/cleanup
    #   GET  /guilds/cleanup
    #   GET  /guilds/:ids/exists
    #   GET  /guilds/:ids
    #
    guilds: true

    # Exposes a stats route which can be used to get some stats on individual
    # shards, the machine the bot is running on, as well as uptime and
    # global collected bot info.
    #
    # Route:
    #   GET  /stats
    #
    stats: true

  # The port the API and metrics should be exposed to, the port must not be used
  # by another application on the system, otherwise the API won't be able to
  # start up correctly.
  #
  port: 1256

  # This is the auth token that should be given to validate incoming vote requests,
  # any requests to the vote route that is either missing the auth header, or
  # has a key that does not match the key below will be ignored.
  #
  authToken: 'avaire-auth-token'

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Vote Locking
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Vote locking will limit some features so only users who have voted for the
# bot will be able to use them, voting resets every 24 hours.
#
# When using the vote-lock feature, make sure the vote webhook has been setup
# correctly with the auth token, you can find the auth token setting in the
# metrics above. without a valid token setup the votes will not be synced
# in real-time, which can cause a lot of lag between the user voting,
# and them being allowed to use vote locked features.
#

vote-lock:

  # This option determines if the vote-locking feature should be enabled at all,
  # if set to true, any command or feature using the "vote" middleware will be
  # restricted to users who have voted for the bot within the last 24 hours.
  #
  # Enabling this option exposes a "/vote" POST route in the web-servlet which
  # can be used to handle vote request sent by DBL, making it easy and
  # automatic to reward users when they vote.
  #
  enabled: false

  # This is the bot application API token for DBL(Discord Bot List), the API token
  # is used to sync votes between the API and the bot during startup, so anyone
  # who voted while the bot was offline will still get their rewards.
  #
  # You can get your DBL API key at: https://discordbots.org/api/docs#mybots
  #
  vote-sync-token: 'ReplaceThisWithYourAPITokenForDBL'

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# API Keys (These are all optional)
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# API keys are access tokens for different services used by Ava to provided
# additional functionality, all the API key fields are optional, however
# some services may be disabled if they're left out.
#

apiKeys:

  # Google API key, this is used for music requests to YouTube and the
  # Shorten API for shortening links, note the play command will still
  # work with youtube links without an API key.

  # DialogFlow is the service used by Ava for her artificial intelligence,
  # the AI will be disabled without the API key, you can register for
  # an API key on their website as well as creating your own custom
  # AI agent, if you want to use the same AI agent Ava uses you

  # Meow API is a simple services that provides lots of cat pictures, the service
  # was custom built for Ava since the old cat picture services was having some
  # issues. The API can be used without a key, although it will only allow
  # 10 requests per minute, if your needs are higher then that, you can
  # request for an API key.

  # no valid API key is given, the command will disable itself.
  #
  # You can get a free API key that allows 60 requests per-minute by singing up on
  # their website, then going to the "API Keys" tab and creating a new key, keep
  # in mind that it may take a few hours for the API key to fully activate.
